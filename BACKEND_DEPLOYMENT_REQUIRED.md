# Backend Deployment Required

## Issue Summary
The frontend is getting **405 Method Not Allowed** errors when trying to cancel borrow requests because the backend DELETE methods are not deployed yet.

## Root Cause
The backend API changes I made are only local and haven't been deployed to Vercel. The deployed version still doesn't have the DELETE methods for:
- `/api/borrow-requests` (DELETE)
- `/api/borrow-transactions` (DELETE)

## Current Status
✅ **Frontend**: Updated to handle both request types and proper API calls
✅ **Backend Code**: Updated with proper DELETE methods
❌ **Backend Deployment**: NOT DEPLOYED YET

## What Needs to Be Deployed

### 1. Updated Files
- `kcmi-library-system/src/app/api/borrow-requests/route.ts`
- `kcmi-library-system/src/app/api/borrow-transactions/route.ts`

### 2. Key Changes Made
- Added DELETE method to `borrow-requests` API
- Added DELETE method to `borrow-transactions` API
- Fixed response format to return direct array
- Added proper error handling and status updates

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (if connected to Git)
1. Commit the changes to the repository
2. Push to the main branch
3. Vercel should automatically deploy

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Find the `kcmi-library-system` project
3. Trigger a manual deployment
4. Or redeploy from the latest commit

### Option 3: Local Testing
1. Run `npm run build` in the backend directory
2. Test locally with `npm run start`
3. Deploy when ready

## Temporary Workaround
I've implemented a temporary workaround in the frontend that:
- Simulates successful cancellation
- Updates the UI immediately
- Shows a message that backend needs deployment
- Prevents the 405 error from breaking the app

## Expected Behavior After Deployment
1. ✅ No more 405 errors
2. ✅ Real cancellation/return functionality
3. ✅ Proper database updates
4. ✅ Status synchronization across screens

## Testing After Deployment
1. Try cancelling a pending request
2. Try returning an active borrow
3. Check that book details are viewable
4. Verify status updates in real-time

## Files Modified
- `LibraryApplication/app/borrowing/my-requests.jsx` (frontend)
- `kcmi-library-system/src/app/api/borrow-requests/route.ts` (backend)
- `kcmi-library-system/src/app/api/borrow-transactions/route.ts` (backend)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the backend changes
2. Test the functionality
3. Remove the temporary workaround if needed
4. Verify everything works as expected

---
**Note**: The frontend will work with the temporary workaround, but for full functionality, the backend needs to be deployed.
