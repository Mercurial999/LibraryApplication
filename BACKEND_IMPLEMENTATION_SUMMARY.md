- âœ… Book renewal functionality with `ApiService.renewBook()`
- âœ… Book reporting functionality with `ApiService.reportBook()`
- âœ… Tab-based navigation (borrowed, returned, overdue)
- âœ… Real-time status updates
- âœ… Modal for book reporting

## What Backend Developer Needs to Implement

### 1. **CRITICAL: Authentication System**
```
POST /api/auth/login
GET /api/auth/me
```
- Implement JWT token-based authentication
- Store and validate user sessions
- Return user information for the mobile app

### 2. **Book Catalog Endpoints**
```
GET /api/books
GET /api/books/:id
GET /api/books/search
```
- Implement pagination (page, limit parameters)
- Implement search functionality (title, author, subject)
- Implement filtering by availability
- Return book data in the expected format

### 3. **User Books Management**
```
GET /api/users/:userId/books
POST /api/users/:userId/books/:bookId/borrow
POST /api/users/:userId/books/:bookId/return
POST /api/users/:userId/books/:bookId/renew
POST /api/users/:userId/books/:bookId/report
```
- Implement book borrowing system
- Implement book return system
- Implement book renewal system
- Implement book reporting system
- Track book status and due dates

### 4. **Database Schema**
- Create the required tables (books, book_copies, borrowings, reports)
- Implement proper relationships and constraints
- Add indexes for search performance

## Current Status

### âœ… Frontend: 100% Complete
- All screens updated with backend integration
- Modern UI design implemented
- Error handling and loading states added
- Pull-to-refresh functionality added
- Real-time data updates implemented

### ðŸ”„ Backend: 0% Complete
- No endpoints implemented yet
- No database schema created
- No authentication system in place

## Next Steps for Backend Developer

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Set up database with required schema
2. Implement basic authentication system
3. Create user management endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 2)
1. Implement book catalog endpoints
2. Implement search and filtering
3. Add pagination support

### Phase 3: Book Management (Week 3)
1. Implement borrowing system
2. Implement return system
3. Implement renewal system
4. Add reporting functionality

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 4)
1. Test all endpoints with mobile app
2. Optimize database queries
3. Add caching where appropriate
4. Implement rate limiting

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Test Authentication
- Try logging in with the mobile app
- Verify token is received and stored
- Test protected endpoints

### 2. Test Book Catalog
- Search for books
- Apply filters
- Test pagination
- Verify book details

### 3. Test My Books
- Borrow a book
- Return a book
- Renew a book
- Report a book
- Verify status updates

## Important Notes

1. **API Response Format**: The frontend expects responses in the format specified in `BACKEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

2. **Error Handling**: Return consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes

3. **Authentication**: All book-related endpoints require valid JWT tokens

4. **Performance**: Implement database indexing for search functionality

5. **Security**: Validate all inputs and implement proper authorization checks

## Contact

For questions about the frontend implementation or API requirements, refer to:
- `BACKEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed API specifications
- `services/ApiService.js` - Frontend API integration code
- `app/book-catalog/index.jsx` - Book catalog implementation
- `app/borrowing/my-books.jsx` - My books implementation

## Success Criteria

The integration will be successful when:
- âœ… Users can log in and receive authentication tokens
- âœ… Book catalog loads with search and filtering
- âœ… Users can view their borrowed books
- âœ… Users can return, renew, and report books
- âœ… All operations update in real-time
- âœ… Error handling works properly
- âœ… Performance is acceptable (< 2s response time)

Good luck with the backend implementation! ðŸš€
